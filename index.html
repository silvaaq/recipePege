<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<section>

 <ul>
  
  <li>2-3 large eggs</li>

  <li>Pepper, to taste</li>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<section>

  <ol>

    <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. 
  You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>

  <li>Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>

  <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure 
  the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>

  <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the 
  middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>

  <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the 
  fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>

  <li>Enjoy: Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>

</ol>
